# Solana-Bundler-tool
 The Solana Bundler is a powerful open-source script designed to simplify buying and selling operations across 27 wallets simultaneously on the Solana blockchain. This innovative tool streamlines multi-transaction management, delivering efficiency and reliability for users handling high-volume activities

## Initial Setup

To utilize the Solana Raydium Bundler efficiently, please adhere to the following setup and execution guidelines.
 
### Step 1: Configuration

- **Edit the `.env` File:** Before executing the script, configuring the `.env` file is essential. You will need two keypairs:

  - **SOL Distribution Fees Keypair:** This keypair handles the payment of all SOL distribution fees.
  - **Pool Creation Keypair:** This keypair facilitates pool creation. For security, ensure these keypairs are distinct.

  While testing the script, you can employ the same keypair for both purposes. Always store these keypairs securely. 

### Step 2: Execution of Functions
 
**Note:** To maintain error-free execution, it is vital to perform these steps sequentially. 

- **Create Keypairs (Step 1):** Even though not mandatory for every launch, it is advisable to create new keypairs initially or during resets to assure no SOL remains in the wallets.

- **Premarket (Step 2):** This multi-step process must follow a specific sequence:

  1. **Execution Sequence:** Complete steps 2 through 6 sequentially.
  2. **Bundle ID Validation:** After each step, confirm the Bundle ID to ensure successful landing.
  3. **Repeat if Necessary:** If landing fails, elevate the tip and attempt again. Exit if required.
  4. **Cross-Verification:** Utilize the Jito Block Explorer to verify bundle landing. Disregard the "Landed - no" indication; ensure the first transaction is confirmed.

- **Create Pool (Step 3):** Pool creation may warrant multiple attempts:

  - Use function spamming if initial attempts fail to land the pool creation.
  - Enhance the tip, with 0.1 SOL or higher recommended for improved landing chances.

- **Selling Options (Steps 4 and 5):**

  1. **Simultaneous Keypair Sale (Step 4):** Consolidate the sale of all keypairs and reclaim WSOL in Premarket's Step 7 post-rugging.
  2. **Percentage-Based Selling (Step 5):** Execute sales of varying percentages upon request by transferring specific portions of each keypair's token balance to the fee payers before executing a singular bundle sale.

- **Liquidity Pool Removal (Step 6):** The process for removing LP is direct:
  - **Non-Burn Removal:** Without LP burning, it will automatically be removed.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

- **Bundle Success:** Adapt the tip or retry the operation if the bundle doesn't land. Jito Block Explorer serves as a verification tool.
- **Keypair Security:** Ensure keypairs are secure and correctly entered in the `.env` file.
- **Prudent Function Spamming:** Monitor transactions vigilantly to prevent unnecessary SOL expenditure during spam attempts.
